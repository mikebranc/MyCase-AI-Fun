Once in the Settings, click on 'Security' and then click on 'Enable Touch ID Lock'.\\n\\nThe MyCase app will logout automatically after two weeks of inactivity. If you are actively using the app, you will remain logged in, unless you choose to logout manually.\\n\\nCalendar\\n\\nIn the calendar on the app you'll have two tabs: one for your personal calendar, and one to see your staff’s calendar if you have more than 1 user enabled for your MyCase firm.\\n\\nWhen on the calendar, you can hit the calendar icon in upper right hand corner to get to today’s date.\\n\\nWhen adding an event from the floating action button (blue '+' sign) it will default to whatever date you have highlighted on the calendar.

This is found at the bottom right side of your screen.\\n\\nTimers\\n\\nWithin the app, you can start or stop up to 5 timers at a time. The timers continue to run in the background even if you close the app or navigate to a different app. To start a timer, you can click on the floating action button (blue '+' sign) and choose 'Start a timer'. You can also choose to click on the 'More' button and then choose 'Timers'.\\n\\nThe only way the timer will stop (without manually hitting the stop button) is if you are logged out due to inactivity; it takes two weeks of no activity to be logged out. Timers are unique to the device (I.E. if you start a timer on the phone, it doesn’t reflect on desktop and vice versa).\\n\\nMessages\\n\\nOn your Home screen, unread message subjects are highlighted in bold.

Let\\'s take a closer look at each one...\\n\\nEmail Notifications\\n\\nMyCase can send you email notifications with updates and developments related to the cases that you are working on. As you will see later, you can edit the frequency of these emails (every 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.). This will create a digest of notifications that are broken down be each case. Whether you\\'re in the office, in court, or even on vacation, you will never miss an important development.Recent Activity Notifications\\n\\nOn your Dashboard (home page), you will notice an area called Recent Activity. This is a great place to view the real-time activity that is happening at your firm. This Recent Activity feed will refresh for you automatically. As you will soon see, you can choose which items you\\'d like to show and hide in your Recent Activity feed.\\n\\nIn-App Notifications\\n\\nCertain events (new document uploads, new calendar events, new messages, etc.) can have in-app notifications. An in-app notification is the bubble that shows up over the tabs on the top of MyCase. For example, if you have one unread calendar event, you will see a \"1\" over the calendar tab (pictured below).\\n\\nEditing Your Notification Settings\\n\\nOpen the Settings page by clicking on Settings > All Settings in the top right corner.\\n\\nIn the left-hand menu click on My Notifications.\\n\\nYou will be taken to the Notification Settings page (pictured below). Keep in mind, any changes you make to these settings will only affect your account. Enabling or disabling notifications for yourself will have no impact on other users\\' notification settings.\\n\\nEmail Notification Frequency - Specify how often you\\'d like to receive an email with all of your notifications. You can receive emails more frequently by choosing the \"Send every 5 minutes\" option, or you can choose to receive fewer email notifications by choosing the \"Send every hour option\". You will only receive an email when there are notifications to report. For example, if you have chosen the \"Send every 30 minutes\" option, and there has been no activity in the past 30 minutes, you will not receive an email.\\n\\nTurn Off All Email Notifications If you don\\'t want to receive any email notifications based on actions that take place in your MyCase account select the option for Turn Off in the drop down menu titled Recent Activity Email Frequency (pictured below):\\n\\nNotification Triggers - The first column will display every notification trigger in MyCase. For example, you can set what notifications you\\'d like to receive every time a new case is added to the system, an event is deleted, etc.\\n\\nSend An Email - For each notification trigger, you can choose whether or not you\\'d like to receive a notification for it via email.\\n\\nIn Activity Feed - For each notification trigger, you can choose whether or not you\\'d like to receive a notification for it in your Recent Activity feed.\\n\\nIn-App Notification - Certain notification triggers can be delivered as In-App Notifications. You can enable or disable in-app notifications for various event triggers.\\n\\nThere are two event triggers that will always send you an email notification: new messages and new comments.

Every few minutes the app will destroy the code and generate a new one, thus it is constantly being updated. Each time you login to your MyCase account, you will have to retrieve the code from your smartphone and enter it into the system.

The phone will automatically recognize the barcode and advance you to the next step.\\n\\nManual Entry\\n\\nIf you choose the Manual Entry option, you will have to enter the information on your own. For Account, enter the email address you use to access your MyCase account. For Key, enter the Secret Key displayed underneath the barcode in Step 2.

Now, copy the information from the exported spreadsheet into the MyCase spreadsheet. Make sure that you are copying the data into the right columns. A screenshot of the MyCase Case Import Spreadsheet is below (with information about each column):\\n\\nA - Case/Matter Name: Enter the name of the case as you\\'d like it to appear in MyCase. This is the only required field in the database. Please note: case names must be unique.\\n\\nB - Number: Enter the case number (this can be a court assigned number, or an internal ID number).

You will also need to add in Custom Fields in your settings to allow for this. For cases, name the custom field “Link ID\". For contacts, name the custom field “Case Link IDs”. (You can alternatively link your contacts to cases manually after you’ve completed the import.) Step-by-step:\\n\\nAdd Link ID Custom Field- At the top of the Custom Fields page you will see the tabs \"Cases/Matters\" and \"Contacts\".

Click on \"cases\" and download the import template. You will notice on the cases spreadsheet there is a column for Link ID and on the contact spreadsheet there is a column for Case Link IDs. On the cases spreadsheet, assign each case a unique, numerical Link ID. This number is not relevant to the case and is used internally for linking purposes.On the contacts spreadsheet, under the Case Link IDs column, enter the Link ID associated with the cases you would like to link the contact to. If a contact has multiple cases, separate each link ID with a comma then space. For example if contact Jane Doe is linked to 3 cases with the following link IDs you would enter: \"3, 4, 5\".\\n\\n6 - Save your CSV file from the Case Import Spreadsheet\\n\\nOnce you have copied over all of your cases and double checked that everything looks OK, it is now time to create a CSV export of the spreadsheet.

For example, you could apply a discount to:\\n\\nOnly time entries, but not expenses\\n\\nThe sub-total of the entire invoice\\n\\nA custom dollar amount\\n\\nHere is how you can add a discount to an invoice:\\n\\nOpen the Invoice Editor (for new invoices or existing invoices).\\n\\nScroll down on the page to view the Adjustments block (pictured below).\\n\\nClick on Add Adjustment.\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at the different options you have when adding a discount to an invoice.\\n\\nItem - Choose Discount from the Item dropdown menu.\\n\\nType - The Type dropdown menu will let you designate the discount as a Percentage discount or Dollar Amount discount. The Percentage option is for situations like \"I\\'d like to apply a 10% discount to the time entries\". The Dollar Amount option is for situations like \"I\\'d like to knock off $1,500 from this invoice\".\\n\\nNotes - Enter any notes for the discount line item as you\\'d like it to appear on the invoice itself. This is useful for describing the nature of the discount (for example, you could write something like \"10% discount for your last payment being early\".\\n\\nBasis - The basis column is used when you are setting up a Percentage discount. Basis designates the amount that the percentage discount will be applied to. For example, if you choose to apply a Percentage discount to all time entries, the Basis column will populate with the total dollar amount of all the time entries on the invoice. You can edit the Basis column whenever you\\'d like.\\n\\nPercentage - If you are adding a Percentage discount type, specify the percentage you\\'d like to discount.\\n\\nAmount - This column shows you the final discount dollar amount for the line item. If you are applying a Percentage discount type, the Amount column is not editable (it is calculated from the Basis and Percentage column). If you are adding a Dollar Amount discount, the Amount column is where you can designate the dollar amount you\\'d like to discount the invoice for.\\n\\nOverview of Adjustments - This area gives you an overview of the adjustments added to this invoice for the specific case. In this example, we see the \\'Anderson Estate Preparation discounts\\'.\\n\\nYou can apply as many discount line items to an invoice as you\\'d like. This enables you to setup more complex discount situations like applying a 15% discount to time entries, and a $150 discount because the client paid their last invoice early. It is a very flexible feature.\\n\\nHow do I apply tax to an invoice?How do I add interest to an invoice?', metadata={'source': 'https://support.mycase.com/en/articles/6197280-how-do-i-discount-an-invoice'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='OverviewPayment PlansBalance Forwarding Turning off Auto-Apply Interest for Individual Invoices\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nThis is a firm-wide setting that can be enabled/configured from the Client Billing & Invoice Settings page: When enabled, MyCase will automatically add a new late fee line item to invoices based on the firm\\'s designated settings. NOTE: interest will only be applied to invoices created AFTER this setting is enabled. Past invoices will not be impacted.\\n\\nSupported configurations include:\\n\\nPercentage: the fee percentage to be applied to an overdue invoice.\\n\\nInterest Type: Simple: The interest rate will be applied solely to the invoice\\'s principal.Compound: The interest rate will be applied to both the invoice\\'s principal and previously accrued interest amounts.\\n\\nCharge interval in days: the cadence in which additional interest will be applied.\\n\\nLate fees grace period: the number of days after the invoice\\'s due date on which the first interest line item will be applied.\\n\\nIn the image above, a user has designated a 1% fee (12.8% APR) to be charged to an invoice starting one day after the invoice\\'s due date. Additional interest will be added every 30 days until the invoice is paid.\\n\\nPayment Plans\\n\\nIf an invoice has been added to a payment plan, we will charge interest on the individual installments of the plan. For instance, let\\'s consider a scenario in which a $1000 invoice is broken into four installments of $250, each due 30 days apart. The invoicing firm has auto-apply interest enabled to add a 2% simple interest line item to an invoice the day after the invoice is due, with additional interest added every 30 days. If the client is delayed in paying both the first two installments, the first by 32 days and the second by two days, the first installment will have accumulated two interest line items, each for 2% of the principal totaling $10, and the second installment will have accrued one interest line item of 2% totaling $5.\\n\\nBalance Forwarding\\n\\nIf an invoice contains a forwarded balance from a previous invoice, we will treat the forwarded balance as part of the invoice\\'s subtotal, similar to any other line item (e.g. time entries). For example, let\\'s consider the scenario in which a firm has configured MyCase to apply a 1% simple interest on a 30 day cadence for late invoices, starting one day after the invoice is due. This firm forwarded an outstanding $1000 balance to a new invoice that also has a $100 time entry and is due on July 1st. We will apply the 1% interest on July 2nd to the total balance of $1100, totaling $11 in interest. We will apply a second $11 interest line item 30 days later.\\n\\nTurning Off Auto-Apply Interest for Individual Invoices\\n\\nBy default, all invoices created after enabling auto-apply interest will be subject to the configurations designated by your firm. If you wish to disable auto-application of interest for an individual invoice, you may do so by opening the relevant invoice and toggling off \"Auto-Apply Late Fee\" in the top right hand corner of the invoice.', metadata={'source': 'https://support.mycase.com/en/articles/6138999-auto-apply-interest-for-overdue-invoices'}),\n",

In MyCase, you create a case, give it a name, and it becomes the place where all of the events, documents, tasks, bills, etc., related to that case are stored.\\n\\nContacts - Contacts are everyone from clients, attorneys, paralegals, and staff who have been entered into MyCase.\\n\\nWhen creating a new case, you will be asked to link contacts to it. Linking clients, attorneys, paralegals, and staff to a case lets the system know who is associated with the case and who should be notified when additions/changes are made to it. Creating these linked relationships between cases and contacts is important for a few reasons:\\n\\nSharing items with clients - The true power of MyCase lies in its ability to provide clients 24/7 access to shared case information. However, we have built in precautions to prevent you from accidentally sharing items (events, documents, bills, etc.) with the wrong client. You can only share items from a particular case with clients that have been linked to that case.\\n\\nSharing items with firm users - Depending on their access permissions, certain firm users (attorneys, paralegals, staff) may only be allowed to access information from cases they have a direct involvement in (the cases they are linked to). If these users are not linked to a case they should be associated with, they will not have access to its files.\\n\\nNotifications of additions and changes to your cases - When additions and changes are made to a case, the system sends notifications to everyone linked to the case. This ensures a real-time, collaborative environment that keeps everyone updated on the latest developments and progress. It is important to realize that you only receive notifications about cases you are linked to. That way, even if there are several active case at a given time, you'll only receive updates about the ones you are directly involved in.\", metadata={'source': 'https://support.mycase.com/en/articles/6110100-mycase-101-linking-contacts-to-a-case'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='One of the most powerful features of MyCase is its ability to let your law firm collaborate and communicate with clients like never before. The MyCase Client Portal provides a secure environment for you to share case information, billing information, and communicate with clients and contacts. Instead of relying on scattered channels of communication (email, phone, text message, traditional mail), the MyCase Client Portal will become your clients\\' one-and-only platform for communication. Allowing your clients use of the client portal does not add any extra cost to your monthly subscription.\\n\\nClient Dashboard\\n\\nThe screen shot below shows the Client Dashboard. It\\'s what your clients first see when they login to their MyCase account. Let\\'s take a look at the elements of this page:\\n\\nNavigation Tabs - The client has access to 5 sections: Home, Inbox, Documents, Events, and Billing. In the screen shot above, notice the red bubbles over the Calendar, Billing, and Messaging tab.\\n\\nClient Action Buttons - These are the main actions that the client can perform in MyCase. They can send you a secure message through the portal. If they are linked to a case, they will be able to upload a document that will be shared with you. Your firm will be notified when a client uploads a new document. Finally, if you have shared an invoice or trust request will your client they will be able to view that item and make a payment (if your firm has Online Payments turned on).\\n\\nWhat\\'s New - This area lets the client know if they have new calendar events, invoices, documents, or messages waiting for them. Anytime a new item is shared with the client, it will appear here.\\n\\nUpcoming Events - If your client has upcoming events , they will appear here on their home dashboard.\\n\\nRecent Activity- Clients get their own Recent Activity stream that gives updates related to their case. It\\'s important to remember that clients will only see recent activity for things that have been shared with them. If you were to upload a document to their case file, but NOT share it with them, they wouldn\\'t see the new document appear in the Recent Activity stream.\\n\\nMy Account- Client can edit their contact information or password in this section. They can also set up their time zone and automatic logout times within their preferences.\\n\\nClients can send and receive documents\\n\\nYour clients no longer have to use email or traditional mail to send you documents. They can upload documents right into MyCase from their Client Portal. When they click the Documents tab, they can upload a document securely by clicking the orange Upload Document icon:\\n\\nYour client will name the document they are about to upload, add an optional description, and choose the file from their computer they would like to upload. When a client uploads the document, all firm users associated with the linked case will be notified that the client has uploaded a new document. When you share documents with your client, they will see them filed away under the folders that you name in your case file. The folders that clients can see are only shown if they have a document within them that has a document shared.Note: When clients upload documents through the portal, they will be uploaded directly to the case folder, but can be moved to another folder if desired by a user at the firm.\\n\\nClients Can Send Secure Messages\\n\\nInstead of emailing or calling the firm, your clients can send secure messages from MyCase. When they click the Messages tab, they\\'ll be taken to the New Message window (pictured below).\\n\\nThe client can select which firm users to send a message to. In the example above, there is only one attorney linked to their matter in MyCase. The client checks the box next to the people they\\'d like to send the message to. They can then enter a subject, the body of the message and hit send.\\n\\nWhen the clients sends the message, everyone that was checked in the \"To\" field will receive a notification that the client has sent them a new message.\\n\\nPaying Invoices or Requests for Funds\\n\\nWhen a client clicks on an invoice, they can review all the details.

Therefore if a contact has many cases, they can have a different role for each case. In best practice, roles should be used to define the contact relationship in a case. This relationship can be relative to other contacts linked to the case (i.e. Spouse). Using roles will help you and your colleagues easily understand contact relationships in a case. Roles will also be useful in determining if there is a conflict when running conflict checks.Contact Groups- Each contact can only be assigned one contact group. Groups are useful for labeling contacts with general labels that do not change from case to case (i.e. Client, Judge).

Any changes you make in MyCase Drive are automatically synced to the MyCase cloud and vice versa in a system designed for law firms.\\n\\nYou must install MyCase Desktop on your computer in order to use MyCase Drive. MyCase Drive FAQsMyCase Drive TroubleshootingHow to Use MyCase DriveOther helpful articles for MyCase Drive:\\n\\nGetting Started with MyCase Drive\\n\\nHow to Use MyCase Drive\\n\\nMigrating Documents with MyCase Drive\\n\\nMyCase Drive FAQs\\n\\nWhat is MyCase Drive?\\n\\nMyCase Drive is a virtual drive that is installed on both PC and Mac computers. It works similarly to the desktop experience for OneDrive or Google Drive. All documents continue to be stored in the MyCase cloud and can be accessed, organized, and managed directly from the computer's File Explorer (PC) or Finder (Mac). Any changes that are made from MyCase Drive are automatically synced to the MyCase cloud and vice versa.\\n\\nHow can I access MyCase Drive?\\n\\nMyCase Drive is a feature in MyCase Desktop, a desktop application that must be installed on each computer. MyCase Drive is only available to MyCase Advanced subscribers. Admin users can upgrade to Advanced in the Billing section of your settings in MyCase. Click here for more information on how to install and first use MyCase Desktop.\\n\\nHow secure is MyCase Drive?\\n\\nMyCase Drive is as secure as our web application with bank-grade encryption. All documents are synced over TLS 2.0 and all data in transit has 256 bit encryption.\\n\\nAre documents stored locally and/or accessible offline?\\n\\nNo, documents are not stored locally on the computer and do not take up disc space until they are opened on a computer. A user must remain online in order to access documents and sync them to MyCase. If a user loses internet access and tries to save changes back to MyCase, Drive will not re-attempt to sync the file once a user regains internet connection. We plan to make improvements to this functionality.\\n\\nHow are the top level case folders added to MyCase Drive?\\n\\nThe case folders (with the name of the case) are automatically generated by MyCase. All open cases will have a case folder in Drive. When a new case is added, a new folder will be created for it in MyCase Drive. Please note that it may take up to two minutes for the case folder to appear. These folders cannot be moved or deleted by a user.\\n\\nWhat cases are synced to MyCase Drive?\\n\\nOnly active cases are currently synced to MyCase Drive. We have plans to release Dynamic Folder Structure where the firm can choose to access files in Closed Cases in a separate folder from Open Cases.\\n\\nHow do I manage access to case folders in MyCase Drive?\\n\\nMyCase Drive leverages the same case access permissions established in MyCase web. A user can only see case folders in MyCase Drive that they can see in MyCase web.\\n\\nDoes MyCase Drive recognize add, edit, and delete document permissions?\\n\\nIf a user does not have the add or edit permission in MyCase, any new or updated document will not be synced to MyCase (but their change will be reflected in their own MyCase Drive). If a user does not have the delete permission, any deletion action will not be synced to MyCase (but the file will be deleted from their own MyCase Drive).\\n\\nHow quickly are changes synced between MyCase Drive and MyCase cloud?\\n\\nChanges that are made from MyCase Drive are synced within seconds to the MyCase cloud so that everyone else in the firm can see the change from MyCase web, their own MyCase Drive, or MyCase mobile.Changes that are made from MyCase web, other firm members' MyCase Drive, or MyCase Mobile are synced to MyCase every two minutes.\\n\\nWhat happens if two firm members are working on the same document at the same time?\\n\\nMyCase Drive will not prevent two firm members from working on the same document at the same time. Each user will save their own version of the document back to MyCase. Only the last version will be available in MyCase Drive. All versions of the document will be available to download in the Document Details page in MyCase web, which will allow users to manually merge changes across multiple versions.\\n\\nWhy do some of my documents in MyCase Drive have numbers appended to them?\\n\\nUnlike most document management systems, MyCase allows users to upload files with the same name. File Explorers / Finders do not support files with the same name. Therefore, MyCase Drive will append the document ID to the end of the file name when it is displayed in MyCase Drive. This does not change the actual file name.\\n\\nWhat happens to files or folders I delete from MyCase Drive?\\n\\nFiles will be added to the MyCase Trash Bin where firm members with the Document Restore permission can restore them if desired. Deleting folders in the app will add all files to the Trash Bin, but the folders will remain. Deletion of folders themselves is currently not supported in MyCase Drive.\\n\\nWhat is the difference between File Sync, MyCase Desktop, and MyCase Drive?\\n\\nMyCase File Sync has been renamed MyCase Desktop. MyCase Desktop is a desktop application that works for firms in the Pro and Advanced tiers. Basic subscribers cannot use MyCase Desktop.Pro and Advanced subscribers can use MyCase Desktop (the feature previously called MyCase File Sync) to edit an existing document from MyCase web using the software of your choice. The changes you make on the document will then sync back to MyCase as a new document version. MyCase Desktop removes the need to upload/download documents to MyCase during the editing process. To learn more about MyCase Desktop, please visit our help article here.MyCase Advanced subscribers can utilize a more seamless connection to their desktop with MyCase Drive, providing fast and easy desktop access to all case documents in one centralized cloud-based platform. MyCase Drive completely removes the need to manually upload or download case documents to MyCase ever again.\\n\\nWhy are eSignature documents missing from MyCase Drive?\\n\\nWe need to prevent users from editing documents that have been sent for signature in order to preserve the document being signed. This allows us to maintain compliance with related eSignature laws.\\n\\nIs there a limit to the number of cases or documents that MyCase Drive can load?\\n\\nWe do not limit the number of cases or documents in MyCase Drive. However, we know that top level Case Folders can take longer to load when the firm has 2,000+ active cases on weaker computers.\\n\\nIs there a limit on the size of the files that I can upload via MyCase Drive?\\n\\nFiles larger than 4GB cannot be uploaded via MyCase Drive.\\n\\nWhy do I have two desktop applications by MyCase on my computer?\\n\\nIn some instances, you might have two desktop applications by MyCase on your desktop. They could both be MyCase Desktop or one could be MyCase File Sync. This happens when the application was installed both via an installer (e.g. Drive beta app) and via the app store. This should not cause any issues, but if it causes you concern, you can uninstall both apps and reinstall from the app store.\\n\\nHow can I migrate documents to MyCase using MyCase Drive?\\n\\nMyCase Drive offers the ability to drag'n'drop folders full of documents into MyCase in bulk, simplifying the document migration experience significantly. You can learn more about our suggested best practices for migrating documents here.\\n\\nMyCase Drive Troubleshooting\\n\\nI can't access or see MyCase Drive in my File Explorer (PC) or Finder (Mac).

The goal of this article is to ensure you retain 100% of your calendar and contact items that were created in Outlook in the period between your last MyCase sync and the new plugin installation. In preparation for moving from the old plugin to the new plugin without first syncing data, you’ll need to make sure you have a backup of all calendar events and contacts you’ve added since your last sync to MyCase.\\n\\nNote: The version of outlook shown in this help article is Outlook 2013.

We’ve also optimized the set-up of the sync, so that it can easily be done in just a few minutes on your own.\\n\\nHow to Integrate MyCase with Quickbooks\\n\\nTo begin the set-up, click on your name in the upper-right, and select Integrations & Services.  Once inside this section, navigate to the QuickBooks Sync section and click \"Install Now\" (if you previously used our sync and are upgrading to our new version, you will see an \"Upgrade Now\" button instead).  You’ll then be presented with a window, which explains all of the accounts which MyCase syncs to.  We’ll present the accounts in this article in the order which you’ll see them during self-setup, so from this screen click the Connect to QuickBooks button - you’ll then be asked to input your credentials and Authorize the sync between MyCase and QuickBooks.After authorizing the sync, you’ll be presented with the first screen of the set-up, where you’ll be asked for the three required accounts needed to start using the sync:\\n\\nOperating Bank Account - This is your firm’s checking account, which contains funds for your firm operations – payments from customers are deposited into this account.Income Account - Money earned from the sale of your services is recorded as income. Your firm might have one income account or several, depending on the detail needed for your financial analysis. For our integration we are only able to specify a single income account, this account should be specifically for legal fee income that you receive from your clients.Client Expenses Account - Client expenses are many times called “Advanced Client Costs”. This account is used when paying expenses on behalf of your client. Advanced Client Costs are typically set-up as an Asset, usually an Other Current Asset, as the IRS considers these to be a loan that will be paid back by your client.\\n\\nOnce you’ve selected the above three accounts, click \"Next\", where you’ll be presented with a question about General (non-trust) retainers.\\n\\nOperating Liability Account - This account is used for general or non-trust retainers, to help track retainers which are deposited directly into your Operating Bank Account, since the money is intermingled with the Firm’s funds. Unlike Trust Accounting, there is no transfer of funds, this is used strictly to account for the “credit” the client has left before they need to replenish their retainer. If your firm accepts non-trust retainers directly into your operating account, change the dropdown to \"Yes\", and you’ll be prompted to specify the liability account associated with your retainers - many times called a Cash Liability Account.  If you do not accept non-trust retainers, simply select \"No\" and then click the \"Next\" button.\\n\\nThe final screen in the set-up will ask you about your firm’s Trust Accounting Practices.  If your firm accepts Trust retainers, select Yes, and you’ll then be prompted to specify you Trust Bank Account and Trust Liability Account:\\n\\nTrust Bank Account - A client trust account is a checking account set up to hold money that a client or clients have given you in advance of performing work on their case. As money is earned it is transferred out of the Trust Account and into the Operating Account.Trust Liability Account - This is a liability account, which offsets the funds in your Trust Account, so that those funds do not appear as income until they are earned. The amount in your Trust Liability Account should match your Trust Bank Account.  If you are not familiar with how this works, it is recommended that you reach out to your Accountant for more information.After specifying your Trust Accounting settings, click the Complete Setup button, and you’ll be returned to the Integrations & Settings.  You’re now all set to begin using the sync!\\n\\nNote: QuickBooks does not support deposits directly into an \"undeposited funds\" account, therefore you will not be able to use this as your Operating or Trust account.', metadata={'source': 'https://support.mycase.com/en/articles/6102777-setting-up-the-quickbooks-integration'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"In MyCase you will have the option to assess your firm's financial health in a number of ways. It is important to understand the difference between accrual and cash basis accounting in order to make the correct decision for your firm. The main difference between accrual and cash basis accounting lies in the timing of when revenue and expenses are recognized. The Cash Basis method recognizes revenue and expenses more immediately, while the Accrual Basis method focuses on anticipated revenue and expenses.\\n\\nAccrual Basis\\n\\nAccrual Basis is the method of accounting that recognizes revenue on the income statement when it is earned, rather than when the cash is received. This method of accounting will allow you to have a better picture of your expenses. The expenses are reported on the income statement in the period that connects with related revenues, which can be different than the period in which the payment is made. Accrual Accounting will give your firm a better understanding of your business' financial health at the end of the year, as all of your earned assets and liabilities will be shown on the balance sheet.\\n\\nCash Basis\\n\\nCash Basis is the method of accounting that only recognizes revenues and expenses on the income statement when the cash is actually received or paid out. The key advantage of the Cash Basis method is its simplicity, making it easier to track your business' cash flow. For example, let's say your firm agrees to retain a client, so you bill them for their consultation fee. If the fee is $300, under the cash method, that amount is not recognized in the books until the customer transfers funds to you for payment. Under the accrual method, the $300 is recognized as revenue immediately when the client is retained and invoiced, even if you receive the funds a few days or weeks later.\", metadata={'source': 'https://support.mycase.com/en/articles/6263646-accrual-vs-cash-basis-accounting'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='MyCase\\'s Email Integration features let you easily store emails in a case and/or client file.\\n\\nOVERVIEW\\n\\nThis is useful for email correspondence outside of MyCase that you would like to bring into the system. Eliminate scattered communication; MyCase will be the central communication hub for messages, comments, and emails. Email Integration in MyCase also supports attachments (attached files will also get forwarded into MyCase).\\n\\nHow Email Integration Works\\n\\nEach user at your law firm will have a unique email forwarding address assigned to them. They can forward incoming and outgoing emails to that address and MyCase will automatically save the email and its attachments to a case and contact when able to correctly identify them.You will always be able to see all emails that you forwarded in your Messages tab.MyCase’s email integration will identify the correct contact and case when both of the following are true (as long as the Emails Settings are enabled):\\n\\nThe email thread is TO or FROM one contact stored in MyCase with an email address.  MyCase will match the contact based on email address.\\n\\nAND\\n\\nThe matching contact is linked to one case\\n\\nOR\\n\\nWithin the email subject or thread, there is a Case Number (minimum of four characters) that matches the “Case Number” field for a case within MyCase. These emails will be linked to a Case only (not a contact).\\n\\nIf MyCase cannot correctly identify a case and contact, the emails can be resolved, or manually assigned to the case and/or client file by the forwarding user, or another firm user chosen to resolve emails on their behalf.PRO TIP: Help MyCase identify the correct contact and case for the email by making sure the contact is saved in MyCase with an email address OR a case has a matching Case Number with at least 4 characters.Now, let\\'s get you setup with email integration…\\n\\nStep 1: Save the Forwarding Email as a Contact in your Email Program\\n\\nAdd your unique email forwarding address as a contact in your email program so you don’t have to remember the forwarding email address. You can find your unique forwarding email address by clicking on Email Integration in the dock at the bottom of your screen.\\n\\nWhen the Email Integration box opens, click Settings. There will be a field called Your MyCase Email. Sending or forwarding email messages to this address will bring them into MyCase for you. Highlight and copy the displayed email address.\\n\\nNext, let\\'s create a contact in your email program using your MyCase Email Forwarding Address. Open the program you use for email (Outlook, Gmail, Mail, etc.). Create a new contact. Paste the email address into the email field. When you name the contact, we suggest something like \"MyCase Dropbox\" or \"MyCase Email\". That way when you are forwarding a message into MyCase, you can simply type the name of the contact instead of having to remember your Email Forwarding Address.\\n\\nStep 2: Send your emails to MyCase\\n\\nYou can do this by forwarding an existing email address or by BCC-ing new emails to the MyCase Email Contact that you created in Step 1.If MyCase can correctly identify the contact and case for the email, it will automatically save the email to the case and contact.  No additional steps needed!PRO TIP: Make sure that your Email Settings are enabled to allow MyCase to automatically save emails and their attachments to a case and contact if they can be identified. You can check this by clicking on Email Integration in the dock at the bottom of your screen and viewing the settings tab.\\n\\nStep 3: Manually Save Unresolved Emails to MyCase (when MyCase doesn’t do it automatically)\\n\\nIf MyCase cannot identify the correct contact and case, the email will be unresolved.  This may happen if the email is not TO or FROM a contact with an email address saved in MyCase, or the matching contact has more than 1 case.  In these instances, you or <<another firm member who can resolve your emails>> will need to resolve the email to save it to the contact or case.In the dock at the bottom of MyCase, you will notice the Email Integration icon has a red bubble with a number over it (pictured below). This lets you know that you have unresolved emails awaiting your attention. Click the Email Integration icon.\\n\\nYou will be taken to Email Integration screen. All of your unresolved email messages will be displayed here (pictured below). This is where you can assign each email to the proper case/client file, save any attachments that came in with the email, and double check that everything looks OK.\\n\\nEmail Preview - The subject of the email will appear in bold, and a preview of the email body will come after it. You\\'ll also notice the original To and From fields are displayed.  You can read more of the email by clicking “Read More”.\\n\\nEmail Date & Time - The date/time that the email was sent or received. MyCase will try to extract this information from the email, but you can always change it if need be.\\n\\nCase Link - Specify the case that the email should be linked to. MyCase will try to auto-populate this field based on records in the system. This is an optional field.\\n\\nContact Link - Specify the contact that the email should be linked to. This is an optional field.\\n\\nIncoming & Outgoing - Let MyCase know whether the email was incoming or outgoing:\\n\\nIncoming Email - This email message was sent to you by someone else and is now stored in MyCase.\\n\\nOutgoing Email - You sent this this email message to someone and it is now stored in MyCase.\\n\\nAttachments - Any attachments that came in with the email will appear here. You can then choose to save the attachments to a case file, or save them as a firm document. Learn More About Email Attachments.\\n\\nWhen you have specified the information for an email message, click the Resolve button.\\n\\nStep 4: View or Manage Emails after they are Saved to a Contact or Case\\n\\nAfter emails have been resolved, the emails will be able to be viewed in two different places within MyCase. The first area will be under any case file within the Messages section (see below). Here, anyone with access to the case or contact can see the forwarded email.\\n\\nThe second area will be in the Messages tab at the top of your MyCase account under \\'Forwarded Emails\\' (see below).

No. Once an email is saved to a case or contact record, MyCase will store a copy of that email in our system. This ensures that if an important email is accidentally deleted or an employee leaves your firm, you always have redundant copies of important case related communication. If you wish to remove an email copy from MyCase, simply clear the Case and/or Contact fields.2. If I send an email from MyCase, will it show up in my external email client?Yes! Our sync with your email is fully bidirectional. This means any action you take in MyCase (e.g. sending an email, forwarding a thread, opening an unread email) will be reflected in your native email client, and vice versa. 3. How do I view all communication pertinent to a particular case or contact?Go to the relevant case or contact record in MyCase and click Communications | Email. This view will show all email threads resolved to this particular record from any member of your firm. 4. How do I submit feedback for this email integration? Click the “Tell us what you think” button in the upper right hand corner of your MyCase Mailbox. All feedback goes directly to MyCase’s product development team. 5. After syncing my email, can anyone else in my firm view or access my inbox? No. Your MyCase Mailbox is only accessible to you. Only emails that you have actively saved to a case or contact file will be viewable to individuals who have access to those case/contact records.', metadata={'source': 'https://support.mycase.com/en/articles/6093071-mailbox'}),\n",

When a merchant chooses to not comply with PCI DSS standards, there are consequences.  Most of the time, this means heavy fines, charged by the payment brand (Visa, Mastercard, etc…) to the acquiring bank, which will usually pass the cost along to the business itself.

You can do this by clicking the \"Edit\" option on any invoice and scrolling down the page. When an invoice carries a balance, the options will appear.I noticed that clients cannot make payments using eChecks if they are not signed into their client portal. Why is that?\\n\\nAll eCheck network processing is run by an organization called NACHA. Their regulations require certain levels of authentication and authorization that are based on an older system designed to handle paper checks, whereas credit card transactions are authenticated and authorized immediately. The NACHA regulations would require us to basically re-create a login and password flow, which defeats the purpose. If you would like your clients to pay you by eCheck, they will have this option within their Client Portal.\\n\\nNote: If you are using LawPay for payment processing, the client does not need to be logged into the client portal to pay with eCheck.\\n\\nWhat if I want clients to continue to pay through the Client Portal?\\n\\nThis \"Email Invoice\" and payment link feature are 100% optional to use! You can continue to share through the Client Portal and your clients will still receive the exact same experience. If you have clients who have trouble logging into their portal or a portal isn\\'t necessary for their case, then the use of the \"Email Invoice\" feature can help you to get paid quickly on outstanding invoices.\\n\\nAre my clients required to have an email address to pay?\\n\\nNo email address required! While using the \"Email Invoice\" option requires an email to send an invoice with the payment link, the actual link itself does not require the client to enter their email to put in credit card information. You can give the link to your client in multiple ways (such as texting it to them or just printing the invoice itself and handing it to them in person), and your client can pay from there.Firm users also have the ability to take a payment on behalf of a client directly in the MyCase web application. In Office Payments makes it easy for you to charge one time transactions, consultation fees, or over the phone payments.\\n\\nI noticed a link on my invoice, where will this appear to my clients?\\n\\nThis link will appear on the invoice when you download or print it, or when you email it from within MyCase. The link will not appear within the client portal, as there is already a \"Pay Now\" button which allows the client to pay by eCheck and Credit Card.\\n\\nHow do I remove the link on my invoice?\\n\\nTo remove the Credit Card payment link on your invoice, you will need to disable Online Payments for the invoice, which can be done by editing the invoice and scrolling to the bottom of the page. Please note that by disabling MyCase Payments on an invoice, your clients will not be able to make any electronic payments within the client portal as well.\\n\\nMy client told me they clicked on the link and received an error message. What happened?\\n\\nEach invoice has a unique payment link, which may be why the client is finding the error message. Check to make sure the invoice has not already been paid, or the balance has not been forwarded to a new invoice. Another reason this error may have been reached is because the invoice is no longer turned on for Online Payments, which can be checked by clicking the \"Edit\" button and scrolling to the bottom of the page.\\n\\nEmailing invoices directly without the Client Portal', metadata={'source': 'https://support.mycase.com/en/articles/6279119-faq-about-receiving-payments-outside-of-the-client-portal'}),\n",

That document is called a credit card authorization form.\\n\\nWhat is a credit card authorization form?\\n\\nA credit card authorization form is a document, signed by the cardholder, that grants a merchant permission to charge their credit card for a period of time, as written in that document. The form is often used to give businesses the ongoing authority to charge the cardholder on a recurring basis.\\n\\nWhat is included in a credit card authorization form?\\n\\nA credit card authorization typically contains:\\n\\nThe cardholder’s credit card information (Card type, Name on card, Card number, Expiration date)\\n\\nThe merchant’s business information\\n\\nCardholder’s billing address\\n\\nLanguage authorizing the merchant to charge the customer’s card on file\\n\\nName and signature of the cardholder\\n\\nDate\\n\\nBelow is an example of a credit card authorization form:\\n\\nAm I legally obligated to use a credit card authorization form when using MyCase Payments?\\n\\nCredit card authorization forms are a best practice for merchants. While it’s not legally required, It is highly recommended to ensure both you and your client are aware of how charges will be processed for future transactions.\\n\\nDo credit card authorization forms help prevent chargeback abuse?\\n\\nChargebacks protect consumers from unauthorized transactions. They occur when a client disputes a charge from your business and asks the card issuer to reverse it A credit card authorization form is one way to protect yourself against chargebacks. If you have a signed document from the cardholder that gives you permission to charge their card for services rendered, your chances of winning your case with the card issuer are much more likely and less complicated.\\n\\nIf a client initiates a chargeback on a credit card transaction, the MyCase Payments team will immediately contact you to assist you in disputing that chargeback. You will also have clear records of any debited funds from your trust account in this circumstance. If we are successful in disputing the chargeback, the funds will be returned.\\n\\nWhy doesn’t this credit card authorization form have a space for CVV?\\n\\nThere is not a space for a CVV because it’s a violation of PCI standards to record a customer’s CVV. If you’d like to manually input a payment, you’ll need to request the CVV directly from the client each time you input the card.\\n\\nHow should I store signed forms and for how long?\\n\\nPCI compliance standards require that all businesses that process credit card information “restrict physical access to cardholder data.” Be sure to keep cardholder data safe by storing completed forms in a secure room or filing cabinet, and restrict access only to employees who require it to fulfill their job duties.\\n\\nClick below to access the Credit Card Authorization Form:Word versionPDF version', metadata={'source': 'https://support.mycase.com/en/articles/6093091-credit-card-authorization-form-for-mycase-payments'}),\n",

Credit card fees are only deducted from operating accounts to ensure trust account balances remain accurate throughout the lifetime of a case.\\n\\nMyCase Payments FAQs\\n\\nHow will the credit card fees be assessed and billed?\\n\\nMyCase will charge a flat fee on the transaction amount (see \"What are the fees and costs related to accepting Credit Card payments\" below for details). Fees will be pulled directly from your operating account. You will never have fees debited from your trust account. The reporting in MyCase will break down the individual transactions and fees assessed so that your auditing will be easy.\\n\\nIs there anytime that my trust account would be debited?\\n\\nThe only situation where funds might be pulled from your trust account is if the client disputes the transaction with their card issuer. You would have clear records of any debited funds from your trust account. We recommend that you update the language in your client retainer agreement that states that the client will not dispute a charge through their credit card issuer prior to attempting to resolve it with you directly.\\n\\nHow do you handle chargebacks?\\n\\nIf a client initiates a chargeback on a credit card transaction, the MyCase Payments team will immediately contact you to assist you in disputing that chargeback. The funds associated with the chargeback are debited from the original bank account of the deposit, but a provisional credit (if applicable) will deposit back into the original bank account upon document submission to the card brand. If we are successful in the chargeback dispute, the funds will remain in the original bank account.\\n\\nHow do I reconcile my fees against my bank statement?\\n\\nMyCase users with reporting permissions will have immediate access to the MyCase Credit Card Fees Report. This report gives clear visibility to any credit card transactions that take place within your firm\\'s bank account.\\n\\nHow does MyCase help me with PCI compliance?\\n\\nMyCase operates our business and software to ensure we meet PCI requirements. We complete a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ-D) annually, complete and obtain evidence of a passing vulnerability scan with Trustwave, and we follow strict processes internally to ensure that we are protecting all data. We never store any cardholder data in the MyCase application or on our servers and we require clients to enter their card information via the client portal as an additional security measure. We have also built controls into the software to help firms reduce the effort to validate compliance. To learn more about PCI compliance click here.\\n\\nI’m not interested in credit card, can I just use ACH?\\n\\nMyCase Payments is a platform that includes multiple methods of online payment for your clients.

However, when you make edits to a Workflow Template, it will not have an impact on cases that have previously used the template.\\n\\nIt's important to understand how this works before making any changes to your templates. This article provides insight into how the process works.\\n\\nA Real-World Example\\n\\nLet's suppose your law firm has created a Workflow Template called Client Intake Checklist. The template consists of a series of important tasks and deadlines that get applied to every new case your law firm retains. When the template was originally created, it contained 5 tasks. Through the course of last month, the template was applied to a few new cases.\\n\\nAfter the last firm-wide meeting, the partners determined that two additional tasks had to be added to the Client Intake Checklist. You go into the Workflow Template for the Client Intake Checklist and add those two tasks. It's important to realize that those two new tasks will not be added to any cases that previously had the Client Intake Checklist applied to it. Only cases moving forward that have Client Intake Checklist applied to it will have the updated task list that included the two new tasks.\", metadata={'source': 'https://support.mycase.com/en/articles/6620253-editing-an-existing-workflow-template'}),\n",

However, if you have edited existing workflow templates that have already been applied to a case, it's important to understand what will happen to cases in which the old workflow template version was applied to. Namely, the due date calculation component.\\n\\nOne important component of workflow templates are the date calculations they use (learn about date calculations here). When you apply a workflow template to a case and that template has items with date calculations on it (tasks and/or events), you will need to specify the calendar dates used to calculate the task and event dates.\\n\\nAfter a workflow template has been applied to a case and the dates are applied, you can always go back to the case itself and edit the calendar dates used for the due date calculations.\", metadata={'source': 'https://support.mycase.com/en/articles/6395512-editing-dates-of-previous-workflow-templates'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='This article will show you how to create and apply a MyCase Workflow template that contains tasks and calendar events.\\n\\nAdding Tasks to the Workflow Template\\n\\nAdding Calendar Events to the Workflow Template\\n\\nAdding Document Templates to the Workflow Template\\n\\nFirst, click on Settings in the top-right corner and open the All Settings page. Then, in the left-hand menu, click Workflows.\\n\\nClick the button Add Workflow (pictured below).\\n\\nThe New Workflow window will then appear (pictured below). This is where you can setup the basics of the workflow. Let\\'s take a closer look at how this works.\\n\\nWorkflow Name - Give the workflow a descriptive name so you will be able to recognize it in the future. Common workflow names include New Client Intake Procedure, Trial Preparation Deadlines, Court Assigned Due Dates, etc. You may wind up having a lot of workflow templates saved in your account, so the more descriptive you can be naming them, the better off you will be.\\n\\nTrigger Event - The concept of trigger events may seem a bit confusing at first. However, once you understand how they work, you will see how truly powerful they are. Typically, all calendar events in a workflow template will be calculated in relation to an important date (date of incident, date of trial, contract execution date, etc.). For example, when creating a workflow template for Client Intake, you may want to add a calendar event called \"File necessary paperwork with courts\" that gets scheduled 7 days after date of incident. The same is true for tasks - you may create a task with a due date that is 5 days before trial date.\\n\\nTrigger events allow you to specify the names of the important dates you will be using in the workflow template. Then, when you add calendar events and tasks the workflow template, you can can specify whether they should be scheduled before or after the date.\\n\\nIf you are still confused about how trigger events work, we recommend just continuing on with this help article. As you learn more about how the MyCase Workflow feature works, the Calculation Date Labels will make more sense.\\n\\nAdd Another Trigger Event - Clicking this allows you to add another trigger event. Workflows allow for 4 trigger events.\\n\\nWhen you\\'ve named your Workflow and specified the Trigger event(s), click the blue Add Workflow button. You will then be taken to the workflow template editor. This is where you can add the individual calendar events and tasks to the workflow.\\n\\nAdding Tasks to the Workflow Template\\n\\nFind the header for Tasks. Then, click on Add Task To Workflow (pictured below).\\n\\nThe New Task Template window will appear (pictured below). The left side of the window is where you can enter basic information for the task like its name, priority, checklist items, and description. The right side of the window is where you can specify the workflow due date calculation for the task.\\n\\nLet\\'s take a closer look at the due date calculation section...\\n\\nThe biggest benefit of MyCase Workflow is that when you apply a workflow template to a case, all of the task due dates can be calculated for you automatically. For example, tasks can be scheduled 4 days before the trial date, 10 days after the date of incident, 4 weekdays after the arraignment, etc. That way, when you apply a workflow template to a case and specify the dates, the task due dates will be calculated for you automatically.\\n\\nThere are three main components to the due date calculator...\\n\\nCalculate Due Date based on a Trigger Event, Completion of Another Task , or No Due Date - If you would like the task due to date to be automatically calculated when it\\'s applied to a case, select Trigger Event. To have a task be created after a previous task is completed select \"Completion of Another Task\". If you would like to create a task that gets applied to the case but does not have a due date, choose the \"No Due Date for task\" option.\\n\\nTrigger Event - You can choose which date you\\'d like to base the trigger off of. These dates will be labeled with whatever names you specified when creating the workflow.\\n\\nSetup Tasks based on the Completion of Another Task\\n\\nWhen creating your workflow template, you have the ability to create tasks based on the completion of another task. Let\\'s say for example that you want to set up a task to check in the the courts 7 days after filing paperwork to ensure that everything has gone smoothly. You can create both tasks in your workflow template, however, the check in task will not be added to the system until the initial task for filing paperwork has been completed. To complete this, select \"Completion of Another Task\" when creating your second task and then the system will prompt you to select the name of the task that you would like this to be based on. If you would like the system to create the task as soon as the previous task is complete, enter \"0\" days in the Task Due area.\\n\\nAfter your task(s) have been entered you will be able to see an overview of your template like shown below:\\n\\nAdding Calendar Events to the Workflow Template\\n\\nAdding a calendar event to a Workflow Template works the same as adding a task. Simply click the Add Calendar Event to Workflow link to display the New Calendar Event Template window.\\n\\nYou\\'ll notice that the window is the same as the task - with the item information on the left and the date calculation information on the right (pictured below).\\n\\nLet\\'s take a closer look at the date calculation column for calendar events...\\n\\nWeekdays / Calendar Days - When calculating your calendar event, you can choose to go off of Weekdays or Calendar Days. Weekdays will only count days Monday through Friday (work week). Calendar days will count all seven days of the week.\\n\\nBefore / After - Specify whether the calendar event should be scheduled \"X amount of days\" before or after the related date.\\n\\nTrigger Event - You can choose which date you\\'d like to base the calculation off of. These dates will be labeled with whatever names you specified when creating the workflow.\\n\\nAll Day Event / Start and End Time - You can choose whether the event should be scheduled as an All Day event or an event that has a start and end time. If you choose Start and End Time, you will be able to setup the start time and duration in the next steps.\\n\\nEvent Start Time - If you\\'ve designated this event as having start and end time, you can specify what time you\\'d like the event to start. If you\\'ve designated this event as an All Day event, you will not be able to enter anything into this field.\\n\\nDuration - If you\\'ve specified the event as All Day, you can choose how many days you\\'d like the event to last. If you\\'ve specified the event as having a start and end time, you can choose the duration in either minutes, hours, or days.\\n\\nDate Calculation Summary - This is a simple text description of how the task due date will be calculated. It is useful for making sure you have setup the due date calculation correctly.\\n\\nWhen you have entered all the calendar event information and specified the date calculation, click the Save button (bottom right corner of the window). The event will be saved and added to the workflow.\\n\\nYou can have as many calendar events and tasks added to a workflow template as you\\'d like. Simply repeat the steps above until you\\'ve created every item for the template.\\n\\nAdding Document Templates to the Workflow Template\\n\\nYou have the ability to automatically create a document from a template stored in MyCase using our Document Automation feature based on the completion of a Task. To learn more about our Document Automation feature CLICK HERE. Adding a document template to a Workflow Template works similarly to adding a task or event. Simply click the Add Document Template to Workflow link to display the New Document Template window.\\n\\nYou\\'ll notice that a new window appears - this is where you can select the template that you would like to merge a new document with, select the tasks that should trigger this document being created, name the document, and enter a description. Let\\'s take a closer look at adding a Document Template to your Workflow:\\n\\nChoose the Template  - Choose the template that you would like to have a document create from automatically.\\n\\nCreate the document when this task is complete  - Choose the task (already created above) that you would like your new document to be automatically created based on its completion.\\n\\nDocument Name - Assign the name that you would like the newly created document to have. This can always be adjusted on the case level, so it\\'s best to keep this generic when creating your Workflow template.\\n\\nDescription - You can use this space to enter any description for the document that will be created. This description will be viewable by an person whom the document is shared with. You can have as many document templates added to a workflow template as you\\'d like as well. Simply repeat the steps above until you\\'ve added every document for the template.\\n\\nOnce you have created Workflow Templates in MyCase, you will then be able to Apply Workflow Templates to Cases.\\n\\nIn order to apply a workflow to a case, go to the Case Details page. From here, click on the Workflows button to the right of the Notes section.\\n\\nThen, click the Apply a Workflow button on the right. You can apply a specific workflow to your cases, set a trigger event, and share tasks with other users.', metadata={'source': 'https://support.mycase.com/en/articles/6140166-creating-and-applying-workflows-w-video'}),\n",

With Workflow, you can create templates that contain groups of tasks and/or calendar events. Then, with the click of a button, you can automatically apply a workflow template to a particular case (which will add all of the associated tasks and/or events to the case).\\n\\nClick here to view one of our Workflow Trainings!Some examples of when Workflow is most useful are...\\n\\n1 - Every time you open a new case, you have the same 12 tasks that must be completed (get signatures from client, request copy of employment contract, file claim forms, etc.). Rather than having to manually enter those 12 tasks for every new case you open, you can use Workflow to automate the process.\\n\\n2 - When a Trial Date is scheduled, there are deadlines both before and after the date that must be calendared. For example, you might need to have all discovery submitted 14 days before the trial, all payment must be received 7 days before the trial, etc. Using Workflow, you can quickly add a series of deadlines to your calendar.\\n\\n3 - You are a criminal defense attorney that represents DUI clients. Every time you open a new case for a client, you always have the same 12 tasks and 4 deadlines that must be added to the case file. Instead of having to manually create each task and calendar event one-by-one, you can automate the entire process by creating a workflow template for those items and then applying the workflow to all of your new DUI cases.\\n\\nNow that you understand what Workflow can be used for, let's take a look at Creating and Applying Workflows.\", metadata={'source': 'https://support.mycase.com/en/articles/6085007-workflow-overview'}),\n",

SEO encompasses both the technical and creative elements required to improve your ranking, drive traffic, and increase awareness of your website in search engines. It’s important to note that the major search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo are regularly changing their search algorithms. This means SEO is not a static tool, but a strategy that should continue to change and grow with your business.\\n\\nOVERVIEW\\n\\nConsistent Contact Info across the Internet (NAP)\\n\\n\\u200b This may seem trivial at first, but this is actually the 2nd most important factor for local search ranking – second only to actually having a business in the city you're trying to rank for! \\u200b\\u200b This area of SEO is called Citations or NAP which stands for name, address, & phone number. The search engines will scan other websites and directories like Avvo, Facebook, Yelp, Yellowpages, etc. to find your contact info. If they find that there are inconsistencies between the platforms, they will then lower your ranking because they know that this leads to a bad experience for your potential clients. \\u200b\\u200b This can include old phone or suite numbers, duplicate entries on the same site, and even inconsistencies like listing 123 Main St. on one site, and 123 Main Street on another. \\u200b\\n\\nBlogging\\n\\n\\u200b Staying active with blog posting is another great way to improve the ranking of your website. We always recommend keeping your main practice area content easy to read and digest for your clients. You can expand on this main content by adding blog posts to your site. \\u200b\\u200b The blog posts should contain naturally occurring keyword-rich copy, with common phrases that people may use while searching for a firm to hire. You can also use the blog as an area of the site to really drill down on some of the niche areas of your services. \\u200b\\u200b For example, if you handled personal injury cases, you could list Auto Accidents under the main practice area page, then create some blog posts talking specifically about truck, motorcycle, and train accidents. Some other ideas for posts include doing a quick write up on an interesting case you handled, new laws coming into effect, or updates on your business (new staff, office, services, etc.). The main focus is about producing content that will be beneficial to users and to show the search engines that you are staying active with your web presence. \\u200b\\n\\nGoogle Analytics\\n\\n\\u200b Google Analytics (GA) is the most popular digital analytics tool in the world – and for good reason! It's user friendly, free, and helps you make more well-informed business decisions. Here are some of the main advantages of using GA: \\u200b\\u200b Automated Data Collection – Once you set up your account, send us your tracking ID (something like UA-000000-2). After the code is installed, Google will automatically start collecting data. Even if you aren't going to use this info right away, it's great to have access to this historical data for any future marketing decisions! \\u200b\\u200b The ABCs – Google Analytics gives you incredible insight into your website's visitors. They break these down into 3 sections: \\u200b\\n\\nAcquisition – How do you acquire users?\\n\\nBehavior – How do users behave on your site?\\n\\nConversions – Do users take a desired action on your site?\\n\\nSEO Consultants/Paid Advertising/SEM (Search Engine Marketing)\\n\\n\\u200b In addition to the items listed in the table above, there are other optional paid resources you can use to further your website's search presence. These services include: SEO Consultants, Google AdWords, and Facebook advertisements. \\u200b\\u200b We don't offer ongoing custom SEO services, but we do build your site using modern SEO best practices such as unique meta titles, optimized meta descriptions, keyword-rich content, image alt tags, etc. \\u200b\\u200b If ongoing maintenance of your site's SEO is of particular interest to you, we suggest looking into hiring an SEO consultant. Many of our customers find that having a dedicated contact for SEO can be one of the easiest and most beneficial tools for growing their business. Be cautious though – no one can promise a #1 ranking so beware of companies that offer this! Aim for a limited contract until you can see the progress they are making on your search rankings. \\u200b Once you find the right consultant, we are happy to work with them directly to implement any changes on the site! \\u200b\\n\\nQuick SEO Tips\\u200b\\n\\nLink Building – Create relevant, high-quality links to your website from other websites like business directories, bar associations, and social networks. Some suggestions are: Avvo, Facebook, Google Business Listings, Yahoo, Yelp, FourSquare, BBB, and any other local associations or directories. *Remember that consistency of your NAP is crucial!\\n\\nReputation Building – Find satisfied clients to submit good feedback about your practice online through networks like Google Reviews, Facebook, Avvo, et\\n\\nBlog Posting – Post to your website’s integrated blog to expand your site with fresh, relevant content on a frequent basis.

There is no need to create the Contact Us form, it will be listed at the top of your firm’s Intake Forms list. To edit the form, simply click on the name to bring up the Contact Us Form details. Adding fields is just like adding fields to any other Intake Form. To learn more about our Intake Forms feature, click here.\\n\\nOnce your firm is ready to publish your form, you\\'ll just need to embed the form using the HTML code that MyCase will provide you anywhere you would like it to appear in your website. You can also change the width and height of the form as well.\\n\\nEmbedding the Contact Us Form on your Website\\n\\nMyCase gives you the option to require authorized domains for the Contact Us Form using the checkbox. Selecting Required Authorized Domain means that the Contact Us Form will only work on the website domains provided in the Authorized Website Domains section. To embed the Contact Us form in your website first decide if you want to require authorized domains. If yes, check the box and enter your website URL. If no, uncheck the Require Authorized Domain.\\n\\nNote: Be sure to enter the full, end path version of your home page URL (Ex. 1), and do not use a subpage URL (Ex. 2).\\n\\nEx 1: https://www.example.com NOT http://example.com\\n\\nEx 2: https://www.example.com NOT https://www.example.com/contact\\n\\nOnce your website URL has been added, simply click on the </> icon listed on the right hand side of your form. This will copy the designated HTML code that you can paste into your website in the location that you would like it to appear.\\n\\nAn example of this code is:\\n\\n<iframe src=“https://example.com/contact_us/t9ttqhmfviqW7oPvqXjvW1Z4” title=“Contact Us Form” style=“border:none;” width=“600\" height=“800”><!-- Specify a width and height by changing the width/height properties of this iframe --></iframe>\\n\\nAlternatively, you can choose the \"link\" icon next to </> to copy a link for your Contact Us form and share it with potential clients via email, text message, etc.\\n\\nApproving Leads submitted by the Contact Us Form\\n\\nAfter a potential client has completed the Contact Us form a Lead will automatically be generated and placed in the Online Leads subtab within Leads. The Online Leads subtab will list all potential clients that have submitted form from your website or provided link. As a firm user you can then approve or delete Leads in this section prior to being entered as an official Lead. Approving a Lead officially creates the lead details page, potential case, attaches the intake form, and puts the lead into the first column on the lead status board.

Make sure to click save before you preview the form.\\n\\nNote: Setting a form theme will apply to ALL Intake forms and your Contact Us form.\\n\\nFinding the Right Domains to Authorize\\n\\nThe first domain you need to authorize is your website domain. This domain should not include anything like /contact. For example if you wanted to add the Contact Us Form to the web page with URL https://www.mycase.com/contact, then this is the URL https://www.mycase.com/ you put in the Authorized Domain Section.\\n\\nAfter adding the first authorized domain you can check to see if the form loads. If the form does not load and you are using a website host like wordpress, wix, lawlytics, etc., you will need to add a second domain to the authorized list.\\n\\nThe second domain you need to add is the URL from your website manager like wix.\\n\\nHere are step by step instructions how you can find the domains you need to authorize when using wix, these steps may be similar for other website hosts:\\n\\nAdd the iframe to your wix website\\n\\nGo to the your website in your browser (google chrome is recommended)\\n\\nOpen up Dev Tools by right clicking anywhere on the page & click inspect\\n\\n4.

Type  <iframe  in to the search box and search by pressing return when your cursor is in the text box\\n\\n8. When the search finds something hover over the highlighted word (<iframe) with your mouse. If where the Contact Us Form should load highlights blue when you hover on the word (<iframe) then you have found the right place\\n\\n9.

You can also share documents with your team in the Saved Templates section.\", metadata={'source': 'https://support.mycase.com/en/articles/7061292-sharing-templates-with-your-team'}),\n",
